# jeweler 1.6.4, 2011-07-07

 * TODO

# jeweler 1.4.0 2009-11-19

 * Generator now adds gemcutter support by default. Disable it with --no-gemcutter
 * Generator now creates a reek task that works with the latest reek. If you have a previously generated project using it, you may need to change the require line to: require 'reek/adapters/rake_task'
 * Generator now exits with the correct exit code
 * `rake install` no longer uses `sudo` to install. If your ruby configuration needs sudo to install, use `sudo rake install` instead.
 * `rake install` now correctly installs dependencies as well
 * `rake install` should correctly figure out which `gem` binary to invoke now
 * `rake build` now will regenerate the gemspec as well
 * `rake gemspec` now eliminates duplicates for gemspec.files, gemspec.rdoc_files, etc
 * `rake gemspec` now automatically populates gemspec.extensions with any extconf.rb files you have in `ext`
 * Releasing to Rubyforge is now deprecated in favor of Gemcutter.

# jeweler 1.3.0

 * Now supports an additional version type, build. This can be used to add a fourth segment of the version that's arbitrary. One example use is having prereleases.
 * Jeweler now lazily loads, to avoid causing side-effects when running other rake tasks
 * Version can now be set explicitly on the gemspec, rather than relying on a VERSION file
 * Rubyforge and Gemcutter support now hooks into `rake release`

 * Rubyforge support no longer forces the uploading of documentation
 * Generator:
  * Allow arbitrary homepage and git remotes, to decouple a bit from GitHub
  * Support for the riot testing framework: http://github.com/thumblemonks/riot/
  * Support for test/spec
  * .gitignore now ignores emacs temporary files

# jeweler 0.11.0 2009-04-05

 * generator will respect JEWELER_OPTS, as a way to provide default options
 (pat-maddox)
 * Include 'examples' and 'rails' directories by default in gemspec files
 * generated gemspec now will only include files (not directories). also, they are listed one per line, and sorted.
 * Jeweler::Tasks's intializer has been improved:
  * You can now pass it an existing gemspec (othewise a new one will be created)
  * Jeweler sets its defaults before yielding the gemspec to you. This allows you to append to its defaults, so you aren't forced to entirely overwrite them just to add one value.
 * Managing a gemspec's files, test_files, and extra_rdoc_files is now more flexible. They are now wrapped in a FileList, so you can easily 'include' or 'exclude' patterns.

# jeweler 0.10.2 2009-03-26
