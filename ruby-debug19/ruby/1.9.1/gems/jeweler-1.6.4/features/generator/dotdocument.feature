Feature: generated .document
  In order to easily generate RDoc
  A user should be able to
  generate reasonable .document file

  Scenario: .document
    Given a working directory
    And I have configured git sanely
    When I generate a project named 'the-perfect-gem' that is 'zomg, so good'
    Then '.document' contains 'lib/**/*.rb'
    And '.document' contains 'bin/*'
    And '.document' contains 'features/**/*.feature'
    And '.document' contains 'LICENSE.txt'
