Fathom
======

Welcome to Fathom.  Fathom is a library for building decision support tools.  Fathom is the kind of tool you'd want to use when you:

* want to build a reliable knowledge base for any kind of information
* need to simplify a complex problem
* have more data than a spreadsheet likes to use

Just a quick note, this is very unstable.  It is getting a LOT of quick changes to get discrete Bayesian Networks finished.  Then, continuous factors will be introduced.  I'll make a minor version bump when I think the project is stable enough to experiment with.  Meanwhile, you're welcome to contact me directly and discuss your modeling needs, I have several people I'm discussing these things with today as I rebuild this gem.
